you need to create two terminals 
in one of them you need to go in to the backend folder using "cd backend"
type "npm i", and click enter to download the necessary modules
to run the code type "npx tsx server.ts" to the terminal inside the backend folder

in the other terminal need to go in to the frontend folder using "cd frontend"
again to download necessary modules type "npm i" and click enter
then type "npm run dev" to run the code
there you will see "http://localhost:3000" click on it
to go to the login page add http://localhost:3000/login and if you dont have an account click below to create an account
that is all! enjoy
